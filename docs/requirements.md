# Requirements - Screen Intelligence Sdk

## 1. Product Requirements

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Define the core pain point this project solves and how teams currently suffer due to manual, error-prone, or fragmented workflows.

### 1.2 Objectives

- Reduce engineering effort for the target workflow.
- Improve reliability and consistency of delivery.
- Provide CI-friendly and developer-friendly outputs.

### 1.3 Success Metrics

- Adoption: stars, forks, downloads, active users.
- Efficiency: measurable time saved for key workflows.
- Quality: reduction in defects or drift incidents.

### 1.4 Target Audience

- Small to medium engineering teams
- API-first companies
- Enterprise engineering organizations

## 2. Functional Requirements

- Provide a primary command/API for the core workflow.
- Support configuration via file and CLI flags.
- Emit human-readable and machine-readable results (e.g., JSON).
- Return deterministic exit codes for CI integration.
- Provide a dry-run mode where applicable.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- Performance: complete typical runs within acceptable CI time budgets.
- Reliability: deterministic behavior for the same inputs.
- Security: avoid leaking sensitive data in logs and outputs.
- Extensibility: plugin/hooks design for custom rules or providers.
- Usability: concise, actionable messaging and docs.

## 4. Integrations

- GitHub Actions support.
- Optional integration with issue trackers and chat notifications.
- Optional telemetry (opt-in) for usage insights.

## 5. Constraints and Risks

- Fast-changing frameworks and ecosystem compatibility.
- Risk of false positives in AI-assisted analysis.
- Need for clear explainability in automated decisions.

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

- Core workflow works end-to-end with sample fixtures.
- CI integration example passes in a reference repository.
- Documentation includes quickstart, config, and troubleshooting.
- Baseline tests cover critical paths and edge cases.
